STEP 8: when the xontroller is visible on the command line note down the MAC address of the controller. It will look like: 
```bash
[NEW] Device B8:27:EB:A4:59:08 Wireless Controller
```

STEP 9: To connect with the controller type in the terminal 
```bash
connect CONTROLLER_MAC_ADDRESS
```
If th connection is successful you'll see this:
```bash
Attempting to connect to B8:27:EB:A4:59:08
[CHG] Device B8:27:EB:A4:59:08 Modalias: usb:v054Cp0268d0100
